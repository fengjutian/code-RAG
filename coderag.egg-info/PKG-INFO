              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# 🤖 CodeRAG: AI驱动的代码检索与助手

[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![CI Tests](https://github.com/Neverdecel/CodeRAG/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Neverdecel/CodeRAG/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml)

> **注意**: 这个概念验证项目在当时很有创新性，但现代工具如 Cursor 和 Windsurf 已经直接在IDE中应用了这一原理。这仍然是一个优秀的RAG实现教育项目。

## ✨ CodeRAG 是什么？

CodeRAG 将**检索增强生成(RAG)**与AI相结合，提供智能编码辅助。不同于有限上下文窗口的传统助手，它可以索引您的整个代码库，并根据完整的项目提供上下文建议。

### 🎯 核心思想

大多数编码助手只能在有限范围内工作，而CodeRAG通过以下方式提供项目的完整上下文：
- **实时索引**：使用FAISS向量搜索对整个代码库进行索引
- **语义代码搜索**：基于DeepSeek嵌入向量的智能搜索
- **上下文AI响应**：理解项目结构的智能回答

## 🚀 快速开始

### 前置要求
- Python 3.11+
- DeepSeek API密钥 ([获取地址](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys))

### 安装

```bash
# 克隆仓库
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeRAG.git
cd CodeRAG

# 创建虚拟环境
python -m venv venv
# Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac: source venv/bin/activate

# 安装依赖（包含开发环境）
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 配置环境
cp example.env .env
# 编辑.env文件，填入您的API密钥和设置
```

> requirements.txt文件仅包含`-e .[dev]`引用；如果您喜欢可编辑安装，可以直接运行`pip install -e .[dev]`

### 配置

创建`.env`文件并配置以下设置：

```env
# DeepSeek配置
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-v3
DEEPSEEK_CHAT_MODEL=deepseek-chat
DEEPSEEK_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com

# 项目配置
WATCHED_DIR=/path/to/your/code/directory
FAISS_INDEX_FILE=./index/faiss_index.bin
EMBEDDING_DIM=768
```

### 运行CodeRAG

```bash
# 启动后端服务（索引和监控）
python main.py

# 在另一个终端中，启动Web界面
streamlit run app.py

# 从终端查询本地索引（索引完成后）
# 注意：当前版本暂不支持CLI命令，请使用Web界面
```

## 📖 工作原理

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[代码文件] --> B[文件监控器]
    B --> C[DeepSeek嵌入向量]
    C --> D[FAISS向量数据库]
    E[用户查询] --> F[语义搜索]
    D --> F
    F --> G[检索到的上下文]
    G --> H[DeepSeek AI模型]
    H --> I[AI响应]
```

1. **索引**：CodeRAG监控您的代码目录并为Python文件生成嵌入向量
2. **存储**：嵌入向量和元数据存储在FAISS向量数据库中
3. **搜索**：用户查询被嵌入并与代码数据库进行匹配
4. **生成**：检索到的代码上下文被发送到AI模型进行智能响应

```
"如何优化搜索性能？"
"这段代码有哪些潜在的安全问题？"
"为监控模块建议更好的错误处理方式"
```

### 调试问题
```
"为什么搜索没有返回结果？"
"如何排查DeepSeek连接问题？"
"什么原因可能导致索引失败？"
```

## ⚙️ 开发指南

### 代码质量工具

```bash
# 安装pre-commit钩子
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 测试

```bash
# 测试FAISS索引功能
python tests/test_faiss.py

# 测试各个组件
python scripts/initialize_index.py
python scripts/run_monitor.py
```

## 🐛 故障排除

### 常见问题

**搜索没有返回结果**
- 检查索引是否完成：查看`index/faiss_index.bin`文件
- 验证DeepSeek API密钥是否有效
- 确保查询与已索引的Python文件相关

**DeepSeek API错误**
- 验证`.env`文件中的API密钥
- 检查API使用限制和账单状态
- 确保模型名称正确（deepseek-chat, text-embedding-v3）

**文件监控不工作**
- 检查`.env`中的`WATCHED_DIR`路径
- 确保目录包含`.py`文件
- 查看控制台输出中的错误日志
