              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# 🤖 CodeRAG: AI-Powered Code Retrieval & Assistance

[![Python 3.11+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![CI Tests](https://github.com/Neverdecel/CodeRAG/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Neverdecel/CodeRAG/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml)

> **Note**: This POC was innovative for its time, but modern tools like Cursor and Windsurf now apply this principle directly in IDEs. This remains an excellent educational project for understanding RAG implementation.

## ✨ What is CodeRAG?

CodeRAG combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with AI to provide intelligent coding assistance. Instead of limited context windows, it indexes your entire codebase and provides contextual suggestions based on your complete project.

### 🎯 Core Idea

Most coding assistants work with limited scope, but CodeRAG provides the full context of your project by:
- **Real-time indexing** of your entire codebase using FAISS vector search
- **Semantic code search** powered by OpenAI embeddings
- **Contextual AI responses** that understand your project structure

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API Key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CodeRAG.git
cd CodeRAG

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate

# Install dependencies (installs the package with dev extras)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and settings
```

> The requirements file simply references `-e .[dev]`; feel free to run
> `pip install -e .[dev]` directly if you prefer editable installs.

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your settings:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-ada-002
OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4
WATCHED_DIR=/path/to/your/code/directory
FAISS_INDEX_FILE=./coderag_index.faiss
EMBEDDING_DIM=1536
```

### Running CodeRAG

```bash
# Start the backend (indexing and monitoring)
python main.py

# In a separate terminal, start the web interface
streamlit run app.py

# Query the local index from the terminal (after indexing completes)
coderag-cli "how is faiss configured?"
```

## 📖 How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Files] --> B[File Monitor]
    B --> C[OpenAI Embeddings]
    C --> D[FAISS Vector DB]
    E[User Query] --> F[Semantic Search]
    D --> F
    F --> G[Retrieved Context]
    G --> H[OpenAI GPT]
    H --> I[AI Response]
```

1. **Indexing**: CodeRAG monitors your code directory and generates embeddings for Python files
2. **Storage**: Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database with metadata
3. **Search**: User queries are embedded and matched against the code database
4. **Generation**: Retrieved code context is sent to GPT models for intelligent responses

### Key Components

- **🔍 Vector Search**: FAISS-powered similarity search for code retrieval
- **🎯 Smart Embeddings**: OpenAI embeddings capture semantic code meaning
- **📡 Real-time Updates**: Watchdog monitors file changes for live indexing
- **💬 Conversational UI**: Streamlit interface with chat-like experience

## 🎪 Usage Examples

### Ask About Your Code
```
"How does the FAISS indexing work in this codebase?"
"Where is error handling implemented?"
"Show me examples of the embedding generation process"
```

### Get Improvements
```
"How can I optimize the search performance?"
"What are potential security issues in this code?"
"Suggest better error handling for the monitor module"
```

### Debug Issues
```
"Why might the search return no results?"
"How do I troubleshoot OpenAI connection issues?"
"What could cause indexing to fail?"
```

## ⚙️ Development

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test FAISS index functionality
python tests/test_faiss.py

# Test individual components
python scripts/initialize_index.py
python scripts/run_monitor.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Search returns no results**
- Check if indexing completed: look for `coderag_index.faiss` file
- Verify OpenAI API key is working
- Ensure your query relates to indexed Python files

**OpenAI API errors**
- Verify API key in `.env` file
- Check API usage limits and billing
- Ensure model names are correct (gpt-4, text-embedding-ada-002)

**File monitoring not working**
- Check `WATCHED_DIR` path in `.env`
- Ensure directory contains `.py` files
- Look for error logs in console output
